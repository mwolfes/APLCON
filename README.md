# APLCON C++11 wrapper {#mainpage}

APLCON++ is a C++11 wrapper class around the Constrained Least Squares
fitter APLCON by Volker Blobel. Please <a href="https://www.desy.de/~sschmitt/blobel/wwwcondl.html">see 
his DESY homepage how APLCON works</a>. Also, if you use this wrapper 
in a publication, don't forget to cite Volker Blobel's original work:

Please report bugs and improvements!

## Installation and Usage

To build this project, you need
  * GNU compiler version >4.7.2 with g++ and gfortran
  * cmake version >2.6

Then do a standard out-of-source build by executing the following
inside the projects directory:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make

You'll find some executable examples and a library called
`libaplcon++.so` inside the above created `build` directory.

Also have a look at the provided [APLCON++ examples code](src/example)
how to use this interface.

Or you may read the rather sparse Doxygen documentation, which can be
created with 

    make doc

(if cmake found the doxygen executable). A `doc` folder inside the
project's root directory is then created, open `doc/html/index.html`
to start reading.
